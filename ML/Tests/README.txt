About our Tests folder:
========================

1. Explanatory: mirrors the documentation (mainly small tests)
2. Benchmarks : to show performance and to act as system validation (larger tests)
3. validation : places where our code is measured against other systems for validation (Mahout &c)
4. Deprecated : old tests, to be removed at a later stage.
